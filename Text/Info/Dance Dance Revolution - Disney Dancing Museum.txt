The only Dance Dance Revolution release for the N64, DDR: DDM is aimed for the kids. As always, your goal is to jump to the right arrows at the right time.  When you are dancing, familiar Disney characters dance along in the background. Some of the songs are Disney-related, others are Japanese as this was a Japan-only release. The game requires the dance pad to play, sold separately.
