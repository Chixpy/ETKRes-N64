Another entry in the Puyo Puyo series of arcade puzzle games. The evil Dark Prince has caused the sun to augment its size and power to dangerous levels, and thus the Puyo Puyo world is on the verge of being scorched unless you prevent it.

The game features 3 distinct story campaigns, each pitting you against a different set of enemies which you must battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In each stage you face off against an opponent in two different play areas, one for you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like

New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 2P vs gameplay, challenge modes and galleries and other bonus features.
