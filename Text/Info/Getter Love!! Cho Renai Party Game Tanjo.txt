Getter Love!! is a dating sim where a high school student and his friends are having a competition to see who will get a girlfriend first. Because of that and unlike other dating sim games you will have to face up to three human or CPU players to win the heart of the girl (or girls) you set your eyes on.

Game Start, Battle, Ranking and Memories are what the menu options include. 

1. Game Start is the option from where you can access all the major  single and multiplayer modes.

Gameplay: After selecting a name and a character, from the 8 available, you'll be given a 
relationship
head-start"
for
a
random
girl.
The
game
will
then
take
you
to
a
screen

of
the
4
players
can
select
an
action
before
a
turn
starts.
An
action
can
be
viewing
the
dates
you
have
finding
out
each
girl's
interests
or
selecting
a
destination
and
initiating
the
turn.
By
doing
that
you
will
be
transported
to
a
3D
depiction
of
the
map
where
you
will
view
random
events
for
all
4
players.
Events
are
usually
triggered
when
you
find
a
girl
at
the
location
that
you
visited
the
given
time
and
from
there
you
can
talk
with
that
girl
and
if
your
relationship
experience
with
that
girl
is
high
you
can
give
her
gifts
and
ask
her
for
dates.
When
all
players'
events
are
over
the
turn
ends
(1
day
passes)
and
the
same
procedure
is
repeated
until
the
girl's
love
meter
is
high
enough
for
you
to
express
your
feelings
for
her."
